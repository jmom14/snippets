Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.

Arrow functions cannot create a context.

In JavaScript inheritance is achieved by traversing prototype chains.

Prototype objects can be linked with each other to create chains. JavaScript internally can traverse these chains and look for methods and properties
