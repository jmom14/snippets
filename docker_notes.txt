Dockerfile
Blueprint for creating images

Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, 
comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

Volumes
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

In the case of named volumes, the first field is the name of the volume, and is unique on a given host machine. For anonymous volumes, the first field is omitted.
The second field is the path where the file or directory are mounted in the container.
The third field is optional, and is a comma-separated list of options, such as ro. These options are discussed below.

Images
Images are only read-only templates used to create containers
Images are created with the docker build command, either by us or by other docker users
Images are composed of layers of other images
Images are stored in a Docker registry

Containers
If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime object
Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run applications
Containers are crated from images. 
Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application.

Registries and repositories
A registry is where we store our images.
You can host your own registry, or you can use Docker's public registry which is called DockerHub
Inside registry, images are stored in repositories
Docker repsository is a collection of different docker images with the same name, that have different tags, each tag usually represents a diffeent version of the image

Create docker images
-Commit changes in a docker container
-Write a Dockerfile

Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
docker-compose up

Restarts all stopped and running services, or the specified services only.
docker-compose restart

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up.
docker compose down

#list all the containers
docker ps -a

#list images
docker image ls

#remove images
docker image rm <image id>

#initialize docker container
docker start <docker id>

#stop docker container
docker stop <container-id>

#remove docker container
docker rm <container-id>

#see logs
docker logs contianer-name/container-id

#remove all continers
docker system prune

#list volumes
docker volume ls

#remove all volumes
docker volume prune

#scale containers
docker-compose up --scale <container-id>=<instances-number> -d --force-recreate
"add a ports range"

#see container stats
docker stats

#run commands in docker
docker run <image-id> ls /

#inspect
docker inspect container_id

#run tests
docker exec <name_container> python -m pytest

#get docker info
docker info

-i flag starts an interactive container
-t flag creates a pseudo-TTY that attaches stdin and stdout
-d flag starts the container in detached mode
--name flag to name the container
